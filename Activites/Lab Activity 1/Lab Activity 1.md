# Overview of Machine Learning Applications



## Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and improve from experience without explicit programming. There are three main types of machine learning:
- **Supervised Learning:** Learning from labeled data to make predictions.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Identifying patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learning through trial and error to maximize rewards.

This presentation explores real-world applications of machine learning in healthcare, finance, and agriculture, highlighting the problems these technologies address, the types of machine learning used, and the impact on each industry.
